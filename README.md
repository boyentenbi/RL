# RL-reimplementations
My goal here was just to have some fun reimplementing DDPG (before A3C) and policy gradient.

The reimplementations are from-scratch, but I made heavy references to Patrick Emami's blog post when I got stuck (http://pemami4911.github.io/blog/2016/08/21/ddpg-rl.html). 

Spent a lot of time doing this when I should've been revising. Learned a lot more than just forking it, though.
